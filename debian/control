Description: Extract swagger specs from your flask project
 Flasgger is a Flask extension to extract OpenAPI-Specification from all
 Flask views registered in your API.
 It also comes with SwaggerUI embedded so you can access
 http://localhost:5000/apidocs and visualize and interact
 with your API resources.
 It also provides validation of the incoming data, using the same specification
 it can validates if the data received as a POST, PUT, PATCH is valid against
 the schema defined using YAML, Python dictionaries or Marshmallow Schemas.
 Flasgger can work with simple function views or MethodViews using docstring
 as specification, or using @swag_from decorator to get specification from
 YAML or dict and also provides SwaggerView which can use
 Marshmallow Schemas as specification.
