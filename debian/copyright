Files-Excluded: flasgger/ui2

 tests/__pycache__
Comment:
 We exclude the "ui2" directory as it contains too many embedded
 javascript libraries without the corresponding sources and
 the current "uiversion" is 3 that has fewer dependencies
 and this module was packaged for recon-ng which uses version
 3 of the UI as well.
 We also exclude __pycache__ dirs as they contain some files without
 source code available.
